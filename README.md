# GradeWeightCalculator
An app to help students calculate a weighted final grade in their course
The app starts with an empty series of text boxes and instructions for the user

The user can load a txt file formatted in such a way to be read by the application

![Opening file](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65093027/193735075-987684a4-6008-427c-adfa-a71c72436929.PNG)

Once the file is loaded, or the data is manually input by the user, a grade can be calculated

Iterating through the fields, the algorithm sums up the weighted grades and presents a weighted total to the user

The results can then be saved to a file for reference or further editing (to see what grade you'd need on a final to get a certain mark, for example
